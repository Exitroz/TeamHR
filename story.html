            <h2>So it all started at the gym...</h2>
            <p>
                It was just another day at the gym. After the usual workout and aerobics routine with the instructor,
                there was a playful skipping competition. I challenged her—confident in my endurance, though admittedly,
                I hadn’t skipped in a while. The coach was cheering her on, and midway through the contest, I gave up 
                (which, by the way, I never do!). She didn’t just win—she went on to flaunt her skipping skills like a true champ.
                As a good sport, I congratulated her, and we all went our separate ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few weeks later, we met again at the gym and struck up a conversation. We talked about work, life in Enugu,
                and somehow, the topic of Jenga came up. I asked if she knew where I could find one to buy or where people played it.
                She kindly offered to help me find one and even mentioned a few spots I could check out.
            </p>
            <p>
                About a month later, we found ourselves chatting again at the gym. This time, she told me she had quit her job 
                and was on the lookout for new opportunities. I offered to help—and not long after, I was able to get her a role 
                at the firm where I was working.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, our bond grew stronger. We started hanging out after work and spending weekends together. 
                And now, here we are—preparing to say “I do” in the presence of God Almighty, who has made all things possible.
